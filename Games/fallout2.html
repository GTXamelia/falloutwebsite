It is a role-playing game with		turn-based combat, where the player plays the game in the pseudo-isometric view.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-2" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-2">SPECIAL system</label>		<div><p class="green">The protagonist is governed by the system called SPECIAL (an acronym for "Strength,			Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck"), designed specifically			for Fallout and used in the other games in the series. The player begins Fallout by			selecting one of three characters to play as the protagonist, or alternatively they can			create one with custom attributes using the system. Character development is divided			into four categories: attributes, skills, traits and perks. These have been copied or			otherwise adapted in some form or another through the ensuing iterations of the series.</p><br>			<p class="green">Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck are the			seven basic attributes of every character in the game.The SPECIAL stats continually			add bonuses to skills.This is done 'on the fly', i.e. if the SPECIAL stats change,			the bonuses are automatically and instantly adjusted. Some 'perks' and coded events			within the game require a certain level of particular SPECIAL stats.</p><br>			<p class="green">There are 18 different skills in the game, ranging in value from 0 to 200 percent.			The starting values for Level 1 skills are determined by the player's seven basic 			attributes, and initially fall within the range of 0 to 50 percent. Every time the			player gains a level, skill points are awarded that can be used to improve the			character's skills. The player may choose to tag three skills that will improve at			twice the normal rate and receive a bonus at the start. Skills are divided into 			three categories: combat, active and passive. Books, although scarce in the early			game, can be found throughout the game world, and permanently improve a specific 			skill when read.However, after a skill reaches a certain level, books no longer 			have an impact. Some NPCs can also improve skills via training. Some skills are			also improved by having certain items equipped.For instance, a lockpick improves 			lock-picking skills. Stimulants can also temporarily boost a player's skills,			however, they often have adverse effects such as addiction and withdrawal.</p><br>			<p class="green">Traits are special character qualities which can have significant effects on gameplay.			At character creation, the player may choose up to two traits. Traits typically carry			benefits coupled with detrimental effects.For example, the trait "Small Frame" improves			agility by one point, but negatively affects maximum carrying capacity. Once a trait is			chosen, it is impossible to change, except by using the "Mutate" perk which allows a			player to change one trait, one time.</p><br>			<p class="green">Perks are a special element of the level up system. Every three levels (or every four if			the player chooses the "Skilled" trait), the player is presented with a list of perks and			can choose one to improve their character. Perks grant special effects, most of which are			not obtainable via the normal level up system. These include letting the player perform more			actions per round, or being able to heal wounds faster. Unlike traits, perks are purely			beneficial; they are offset only by the infrequency with which they are acquired.</p><br>			<p class="green">The game also tracks the moral quality of the player character's actions using a statistic			called Karma,as well as a series of reputations. Karma points are awarded for doing good			deeds, and are subtracted for doing evil deeds. The effect of this statistic during the			course of the game is minimal; however, the player character may receive one of a number			of "reputations", that act like perks, for meeting a certain threshold of such actions,			or for engaging in an action that is seen as singularly and morally reprehensible.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-3" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-3">Changes from Fallout</label>			<div><p class="green">Fallout 2 features a much wider array of items, weapons, and armor than Fallout. Most of			the items from Fallout returned, but had alternate and upgraded forms: the minigun, for			example, is now joined by the Avenger and Vindicator miniguns. Item prices were also			increased at stores, making scavenging for items more important. In addition to old,			upgraded weapons, several new weapons were introduced for all branches of combat, thus			making no combat skill the best, and allowing the player to be powerful with any weapon.			The range of enemies was also increased to a wider diversity. The end result is a much			more complex combat environment.</p></div><br></div> <br><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Plot</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green"><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-4" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-4">Setting</label>		<div><p class="green">At the end of the original Fallout, the hero, the Vault Dweller, was exiled by the Vault		Overseer for prolonged exposure to the outside world. Unable to return home, the Vault		Dweller, with a group of willing companions, traveled far north. Eventually they started		their own tribal village called Arroyo in what we know as Oregon. Decades have passed		since the original Fallout, and the Vault Dweller disappeared from Arroyo after writing		his memoirs. In the time sin</p><br>		<p class="green">In the time since the Vault Dweller's exile, a new government known as the New California		Republic (abbreviated NCR) has begun to unify the southern towns and is spreading to the		north. A mysterious new organization known as the Enclave has emerged with the most		sophisticated technology in the wastes, even surpassing the Brotherhood of Steel. A new		drug, jet, has become a cancer on many towns, its addictive properties forcing many to		rely on the town of New Reno to keep them supplied.</p></div>	<br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-5" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-5">Story</label>		<div><p class="green">During 2241, the humble village of Arroyo suffered the worst drought on record. Faced			with this hardship, the village elder asked the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller,			referred to as the Chosen One, to perform the quest of retrieving a Garden of Eden Creation			Kit (G.E.C.K) for Arroyo. The GECK is a device that can create thriving communities out of			the post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p><br>		<p class="green">The player, assuming the role of the Chosen One, is given nothing more than the Vault		Dweller's jumpsuit, a RobCo Pip-Boy 2000 handheld device, a Vault 13 water flask, and some		cash to start this quest.</p><br>		<p class="green">The player eventually finds Vault 13 (the first place possible to obtain a GECK) devoid of		the majority of its former human inhabitants. The Chosen One returns to find his village		captured by the Enclave, a mysterious group which is later revealed to be the remnants of the		pre-War United States federal government. The player, through a variety of means, activates		an ancient oil tanker and its autopilot, thus allowing him to reach the Enclave's main base on		an offshore oil rig.</p><br>		<p class="green">It is revealed that the dwellers of Vault 13 were captured as well, to be used as test subjects		for FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), alongside Arroyo tribesmen and women. Vault 13 was supposed		to be closed for 200 years as part of a Vault-Tec Vault experiment; this makes them perfect test		subjects. The Enclave modified the Forced Evolutionary Virus into an airborne disease, designed		to attack any living creatures with mutated DNA. With all genetic impurities removed, the Enclave		(who remain protected from radiation) could take over.</p><br>		<p class="green">The Chosen One frees both his village (Arroyo) and the Vault 13 dwellers from Enclave control,		and destroys the Enclave's oil rig. In the ending, the inhabitants of Vault 13 and Arroyo create		a new prosperous community with the help of the GECK together.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-6" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-6">Characteristics</label>		<div><p class="green">The fact that in Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout 3 the player characters are raised in an isolated		community works with the plot structure, allowing the character to be as ignorant about the game		world as the player would be and explaining why the map the character starts with is almost		completely unexplored.</p></div><br>						</div> <br><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Reception</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green">	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-7" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-7">Response</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout 2 received positive reviews from critics.

Daniel Morris of GamePro praised the mix of action		and character interaction as well as the non-linear gameplay. IGN applauded the developers for		the sizable game world, the writing, and "not fixing something that wasn't broken". Game		Revolution praised the game's depth and storyline, but criticized its graphics and interface.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-8" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-8">Retrospective</label>		<div><p class="green">In 2013, GamesRadar ranked Fallout 2 number 68 on their list of top video games of all time.<br>		That same year, IGN ranked it as the 28th best role-playing video game ever.</p></div></div> <br><!--Music--><h4 class="green">Music of Fallout 2</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4>	<iframe class="music" style="text-align:center" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/173013204%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-B353i&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe><!-- Fallout 2 Pictures --><div style="text-align:center">	<h4 class="green">Images of Fallout 2</h4>	<h4 class="green">======================</h4><ul class="enlarge">	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures"><br>Fallout 2<br>September 30, 1998</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic2.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic2.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures"><br>Fallout 2<br>September 30, 1998</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic3.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic3.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures"><br>Fallout 2<br>September 30, 1998</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic4.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic4.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures"><br>Fallout 2<br>September 30, 1998</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic5.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic5.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures"><br>Fallout 2<br>September 30, 1998</span></li>	</ul></div>	<footer class="green" style="font-size:10px; text-align: center">COPYRIGHT 2075-2077 ROBCO INDUSTIRES</footer></body></html>
