The player decides the character's			general appearance using a Gene Projection, conducted by the father before the mother dies. Afterwards, the father removes			his surgeon's mask to reveal a face similar to the one chosen by the player for the character. As a child in the Vault, the			character receives a book titled "You're SPECIAL," whereupon the player can set the character's seven primary aptitudes. The			character receives training weapons and a Pip-Boy 3000 later on during childhood, and the player's performance in various			tests determines the rest of the attributes. Additionally, several quests inside the Vault are able to influence the player			character's relationship with his or her father. Skills and Perks are similar to those in previous games: the player chooses			three Tag Skills out of 13 to be the character's specialties. Five skills have been cut out from the game (Fallout and Fallout			2 had 18 skills). First Aid and Doctor have been integrated into Medicine, Throwing and Traps have been merged into			Explosives, Steal integrated into Sneak, and both Outdoorsman and Gamble have been removed completely. The maximum level the			player can achieve is level 20 (which is to be raised to 30 after purchase of the third DLC installment, along with the			ability to continue your game after the main story missions are complete). The Traits from the previous Fallout installments			were combined with Perks in Fallout 3, and the player can choose a new Perk each time after gaining a level.</p></div><br><input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-2" type="checkbox"><label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-2">Combat</label>		<div><p class="green">The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S., is an active pause combat system implemented in the game. While using			V.A.T.S., the otherwise real-time combat is paused. Attacks in V.A.T.S. cost action points, and the player can target			specific body areas for attacks to inflict specific injuries. When attacks are selected, V.A.T.S. will then execute the			attack in real-time slow motion, allowing the gory deaths in the game to be shown in great detail. The player will take 90%			reduced damage from enemies during this sequence. It should be noted that while the player has a 15% increased critical hit			chance while using V.A.T.S., weapon degradation per shot is greatly increased, forcing the player to strike a balance between			using more ammunition or losing guns more quickly. This trade-off allows for two very different play styles throughout the game.</p></div> <br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-3" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-3">Karma</label>		<div><p class="green">The Karma system is an important feature in Fallout's gameplay. A player's actions, including conversation and combat			choices, affects the player's status in the game world; a player who makes good decisions is received more positively by non			-player characters, and a player that makes bad decisions has the opposite reaction. Crimes can also be committed by a player,			and whichever faction or group that is harmed by a crime are fully aware of the player's action in most cases. Other factions			that were not affected by the crime will not be aware of it, and since a town is usually its own faction, news of a crime			committed in one town will not spread to another. Beware however, good or evil deeds will cause a bounty by the opposite			alignment group. Talon Company (If you are good) or the Regulators (if you've been bad) will ambush you randomly, and are not			bound to any particular area, they can appear anywhere in the wastes. Factions can range in size and boundaries, however, and			may not be restricted to a single area. The game world itself was planned to be significantly smaller than that of Oblivion's			but is now similar in size.</p></div> 	<br></div><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Plot</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green"><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-4" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-4">Setting</label>		<div><p class="green">The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic Washington, D.C. following the Great War between the U.S., China, the		Soviet Union and other countries. The Great War occurred on October 23, 2077 which caused immense damage and destruction		despite lasting less than two hours. Before the Great War, there were the Resource Wars that nearly crippled the world and		brought riots to the streets, during which the United Nations disbanded, and an F.E.V. plague coupled with global terrorism		rendered the United States paranoid of both real and imagined communist plots. Canada was annexed by the United States in		order to help the U.S. war effort against the Chinese in Alaska. The fact that Canada had the plentiful resources of nearly		untouched wilderness made America's effort well worth the protection the U.S.A. promised to provide.</p></div>	<br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-5" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-5">Story</label>	<div><p class="green">The introductory sequence introduces the Lone Wanderer (player) to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in		Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible		passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of "the waters of life".</p><br>		<p class="green">The main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and		causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a		journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of		town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of "The Lone		Wanderer". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here 		the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project		Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac		River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during		childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 		101.</p><br>		<p class="green">After investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality		program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals		he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components		needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with		intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the		remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave		military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words		urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of		Steel and now known as the Citadel. With Project Purity still inoperational even with the Enclave occupying the site, the		player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for		the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires		the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.</p><br>		<p class="green">At the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who		requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command		of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is		actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West		Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the		water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the		wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic "purity" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and		free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave		peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the		Citadel.</p><br>		<p class="green">With the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson		Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts		Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is		ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal		amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the		extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the		game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.</p><br>		<p class="green">If the "Broken Steel" DLC is installed, the player survives if they activate it themselves, but they also have the option of		sending one of their radiation-immune companions to enter the code and start the purifier with no casualties. The player also		has the possibility to enter the F.E.V. sample into the water prior to activation, having adverse post-ending effects on the		game's side quests.</p></div><br>	</div><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Development</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green"><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-6" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-6">Interplay</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout 3 was initially under development by Black Isle Studios, a studio owned by Interplay Entertainment, under the working		title Van Buren. Interplay Entertainment closed down Black Isle Studios before the game could be completed, and the license		to develop Fallout 3 was sold for a $1,175,000 minimum guaranteed advance against royalties to Bethesda Softworks, a studio		primarily known as the developer of the The Elder Scrolls series.Bethesda's Fallout 3 however, was developed from scratch,		using neither Van Buren code, nor any other materials created by Black Isle Studios.

Bethesda announced their intention to make Fallout 3 similar to the previous two games,		focusing on non-linear game play, a good story, and true "Fallout humor." Bethesda also stated the game is targeted for a		rating of M for Mature, and would have the same sort of adult themes and violence that are characteristic of the Fallout		series. Fallout 3 uses a version of the same Gamebryo engine as Oblivion, and was developed by the same team. Initially		Bethesda held the right to make only 3 Fallout games with royalties to be paid to Interplay.</p></div><br></div><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Reception</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green"><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-8" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-8">Response</label>		<div><p class="green">Leonard Boyarsky, one of the creators of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay's sale of the rights to Bethesda,		said that he felt as though "our ex-wife had sold our children that she had legal custody of," admitting that he feels very		possessive of the series, but also admitted that his concerns have nothing to do with Bethesda. Considerable concern was also		raised by some members of the series' fan community, largely concerning major changes in game play style compared to the		original games and Fallout 3's similarity to Oblivion. The reaction from the press, however, was largely positive, with many		considering the shift to first person view and real time combat an update, and with most considering the similarities to		Oblivion to be a good thing.</p><br>		<p class="green">Sales for Fallout 3 have thus far been very high, and figures suggest that the game has outsold all previous Fallout games		(including all other spin-offs) in its first week.</p><br>		<p class="green">Fallout 3 won several awards following its showcasing at E3 2007. IGN gave it the Game of E3 2007 award, and GameSpot gave it 		the Best Role-Playing Game of E3 2007 award. Following the game's demonstration at E3 2008, IGN also gave it Best Overall		RPG, Best Overall Console Game, and Overall Game of the Show for E3 2008.

In order for the game to be reclassified, the offending content in the Australian version of the game would have to		be removed by Bethesda Softworks and the game resubmitted to the OFLC.[15] According the OFLC board report, the game was		refused classification due to the "realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method (bringing) the		'science-fiction' drugs in line with 'real-world' drugs." Despite this, Australia's Fallout 3 was expected to be released on		October 30, on par with the European version, and was delivered on time with the drug-name changes.</p><br>		<p class="green">On September 9, 2008 Bethesda vice president of PR and marketing, Peter Hines, has described the idea of a censored		Australian version of Fallout 3 as a misconception. All versions of Fallout 3 no longer include real world drug references,		then morphine was renamed to Med-X.</p><br>		<p class="green">Bethesda Softworks changed the side quest "The Power of the Atom" in the Japanese version of Fallout 3 to relieve concerns		about depictions of atomic detonation in inhabited areas. In non-Japanese versions, players are given the option of either		defusing, ignoring, or detonating the dormant atomic bomb in the town of Megaton. In the Japanese version, the character		Mister Burke has been taken out of this side quest, making it impossible to detonate the bomb.</p><br>		<p class="green">Also in the Japanese release, the "Fat Man" nuclear catapult weapon was renamed "Nuka Launcher," as the original name was a		reference to the bomb used on Nagasaki, Japan.</p><br>		<p class="green">Microsoft India decided not to release the game in that country, citing "cultural sensitivities". It has been speculated that		this is either because the cattle in the game are called brahmin, which is the name of the highest Hindu caste, or possibly		due to the fact that the player can kill and eat the cattle, which, as it is a venerated animal, is against the principles of		most Hindu sects.</p></div><br></div><!--Music--><h4 class="green">Music of Fallout 3</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4>	<iframe class="music" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/4765743&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe><div style="text-align:center"><br><!-- Fallout 3 Pictures --><h4 class="green">Fallout 3</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4><ul class="enlarge">	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 3" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout3 Pictures">Fallout 3<br>October 28, 2008</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic2.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 3" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic2.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout3 Pictures">Fallout 3<br>October 28, 2008</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic3.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 3" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic3.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout3 Pictures">Fallout 3<br>October 28, 2008</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic4.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 3" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic4.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout3 Pictures">Fallout 3<br>October 28, 2008</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic5.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 3" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic5.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout3 Pictures">Fallout 3<br>October 28, 2008</span></li></ul></div><br><footer class="green" style="font-size:10px; text-align: center">COPYRIGHT 2075-2077 ROBCO INDUSTIRES</footer></body></html>
