Additional features are a split-piece armor system, base-building, a dynamic dialogue system, in depth crafting		system which implements every lootable object in the game, and much more. Enemies such as mole rats, Mirelurks, raiders,		super mutants, deathclaws, and ghouls will also return to the series.</p><br>		<p class="green">The player character, the Sole Survivor, obtains a Pip-Boy which allows the player to access a menu with statistics, maps,		data, and items. Players can also find game cartridges, which can be played on the Pip-Boy. Another returning gameplay		feature is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), which plays an important part in combat. While using V.A.T.S.,		real-time combat is slowed down, and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of		"bullet time". Various actions cost action points, limiting the actions of each combatant during a turn, and the player can		target specific body areas for attacks to inflict specific injuries; head shots can be used for quick kills or blinding, legs		can be targeted to slow enemies' movements, and opponents can be disarmed by shooting at their weapons.</p><br>		<p class="green">A new feature to the series is the ability to build settlements and buildings. Players can select and scrap objects and		structures for resources and building supplies, and use them to build their own structures ranging from fully-decoratable		houses, towers, bars, labs, and more. The player can also construct more than one settlement across the Commonwealth, and can		send brahmin caravans between their towns. Towns can be powered with working electricity, using a dynamic power line system,		as well as equipped water pumps and crops/gardens to keep a steady income of food and drink. Merchants and non-player		characters can inhabit player towns and help keep the settlements running as a community. Players can build various defenses		around their settlements, such as turrets, guard towers, and traps, to defend the settlements, as they can be raided and		attacked.</p><br>		<p class="green">Another new feature to Fallout that was confirmed by Bethesda Studios on Twitter is that there is no level cap, allowing		players to experience a little more freedom when it comes to exploring and combat. Another confirmed feature that allows even		more explorational freedom is that, also confirmed by Bethesda's Twitter, is that even if the game 'ends' you may continue		playing, a feature returning from Broken Steel, which allows players to experience the aftermath of their decisions. In 		addition, a new weapon system will allow a wide variety of customization.</p></div><br>		<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-2" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-2">New S.P.E.C.I.A.L. System</label>		<div><p class="green">At the beginning of the game, players are given points to spend on a character progression system called S.P.E.C.I.A.L.. The		system represents seven statistics, namely strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck. When		players gain enough experience points to gain a new level, they unlock a new ability. When players allocate more points to a		stat, more abilities can be unlocked. These perks can also be upgraded to improve the protagonist's efficiency and to further		unlock new abilities. There are about 275 perks available for players to unlock. There is no level cap and the game does not		end once the main story is complete.</p></div><br></div><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Plot</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green"><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-3" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-3">Setting</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout 4 takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3 and 210 years after a Third World War over		natural resources that ended in a nuclear holocaust in 2077. The setting is a post-apocalyptic retro-future, covering a		region that includes Boston, Massachusetts and other parts of New England known as "The Commonwealth". Unlike the previous		titles, Fallout 4‍ '​s story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077. The player's character (voiced by either		Brian T. Delaney or Courtenay Taylor) takes shelter in Vault 111, emerging exactly 210 years later, on October 23, 2287.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-4" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-4">Story</label>			<div><p class="green">The story begins on the morning of October 23, 2077, with the player character and their spouse (Nate/Nora) preparing for an			event at the Veteran's Hall when a Vault-Tec representative comes to inform them their family is approved for admittance into			Vault 111. Moments later, a news bulletin warns of an imminent nuclear attack, forcing the family to rush to the vault, where			they are temporarily trapped outside when a nuclear bomb detonates nearby. The platform below them lowers, and the family and			other residents of the town are tricked into being placed in cryosleep.</p><br>			<p class="green">Years later, the player and their spouse are re-awakened by two unknown individuals, who open the spouse's Cryo tube with the			intent of taking the player's baby, Shaun. When the spouse tries to prevent the kidnapping they are killed by one of the			strangers, who takes Shaun and reactivates the survivor's Cryo tube. The Sole Survivor manages to get free of their Cryo tube			in 2287, where they discover that they are the only survivor of Vault 111, as the remaining residents have died due to the			strangers tampering with the Cryo tube controls and life-support system. Once they emerge from Vault 111, the Sole Survivor			vows to avenge their spouse's death and find Shaun.</p><br>			<p class="green">From here, the player is instructed to go to Diamond City, a settlement based in Fenway Park. With assistance from Nick			Valentine, a synth detective, they locate their spouse's killer, a man named Conrad Kellogg, who reveals their child is in			the Institute, a secretive organization based below the ruins of the Commonwealth Institute of Technology. The player			retrieves a cybernetic implant from the brain of the killer, and after viewing their memories, discovers they can only get to			the Institute via teleportation.</p><br>			<p class="green">The player has to build a teleportation device to reach the Institute, and can ask for assistance from one of three factions:			the Minutemen, the Railroad, or the Brotherhood of Steel. Once this device is built, the player infiltrates the Institute to			find their son. After finding a child synth based on their son, it is revealed the player's son was kidnapped in 2227, sixty			years prior to their release from cryogenic sleep, and is now an old man who is the leader of the Institute.</p>	<br>			<p class="green">The player then faces a choice: They can side with Shaun and help the Institute with their takeover of the Commonwealth by			destroying the Railroad and the Brotherhood of Steel, Shaun dies of cancer not long after and names the player as his			successor. They can also side against Shaun by assisting one of the other three factions, they can assist the Railroad in			destroying the Institute and the Brotherhood of Steel in order to free and protect the synths, help the Brotherhood of Steel			destroy the Institute and the Railroad in order to exterminate the synths or help the Minutemen destroy the Institute (and			the Brotherhood of Steel if the player is their enemy) in order to protect the Commonwealth.</p></div><br></div><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Reception</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green">	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-5" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-5">Pip-Boy Edition</label>		<div><p class="green">The Pip-Boy edition of Fallout 4 features: a wearable Pip-Boy that can, according to a Forbes article, hold the iPhone 6,		iPhone 5/5s, iPhone 4/4s, Samsung Galaxy S4, the Samsung Galaxy S5 and many other smartphones using foam inserts. a Pip-Boy		pocket guide, a Vault-Tec perk poster, a RobCo Industries stand (for your Pip-Boy), a capsule case, and the game in a		collectible metal case.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-6" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-6">Response</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout 4 received positive reviews.

Brown praised the "thought-provoking" narrative, "intuitive" creation		tools, the large amount of content, the overall combat, and the overall freedom the player is given, especially in world		exploration and story progression. Brown's main criticisms were concerning the average visuals, the technical issues,		and the unintuitive management of companions, the map, and the inventory.</p><br>		<p class="green">Game Informer's Andrew Reiner scored the game a 9 out of 10 and said: "Bethesda has created another game you can lose your		life in. New experiences just keep coming, and you always have another perk to unlock." Reiner praised the "vastly improved"		combat, the "denser" world, and the "brilliant" score, but had mixed feelings about the visuals, saying: "The visuals can be		simultaneously breathtaking and a little ugly. The vistas and lighting are beautifully created, but some of the texture work		is muddled and steals some of the finer details." Reiner was also relieved to not run into many glitches.</p></div><br></div><br><!--Music--><h4 class="green">Music of Fallout 4</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4><iframe class="music" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/161125439&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe><div style="text-align:center"><br><!-- Fallout 4 Pictures --><h4 class="green">Fallout 4</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4><ul class="enlarge">	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 4 Pictures" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Fallout4 Pictures">Fallout 4<br>November 10, 2015</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic2.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 4 Pictures" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic2.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Fallout4 Pictures">Fallout 4<br>November 10, 2015</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic3.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 4 Pictures" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic3.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Fallout4 Pictures">Fallout 4<br>November 10, 2015</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic4.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 4 Pictures" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic4.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Fallout4 Pictures">Fallout 4<br>November 10, 2015</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic5.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 4 Pictures" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic5.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Fallout4 Pictures">Fallout 4<br>November 10, 2015</span></li></ul></div><br><footer class="green" style="font-size:10px; text-align: center">COPYRIGHT 2075-2077 ROBCO INDUSTIRES</footer></body></html>
