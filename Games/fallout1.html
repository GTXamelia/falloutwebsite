Occasionally, inhabitants will be immersed in dilemmas			which the player may choose to solve in order to acquire karma and experience points.			Fallout deviates from most role-playing video games in that it often allows for the			player to complete tasks in multiple ways, often choosing solutions that are			unconventional or even contrary to the original task, in which case the player may still			be rewarded. The player's actions may ultimately dictate the ending of the game, or what			future story or gameplay opportunities are available. Ultimately, players will encounter			hostile opponents (if such encounters are not avoided using stealth or diplomacy),			in which case they and the player will engage in combat. Non-combat portions of the game			are typically played in real-time.</p><br>			<p class="green">Combat in Fallout is turn-based. The game uses an action point system wherein, each turn,			multiple actions may be performed until all points in the pool have been expended.			Different actions consume different numbers of points, and the maximum number of points			that can be spent may be affected by such things as chems or perks. 'Melee' (hand to hand)			weapons typically offer multiple attack types, such as 'Swing' and 'Thrust' for knives.			Unarmed attacks offer many attack types, including 'Punch' and 'Kick'. Players may equip			at most two weapons, and the player can switch between them at the click of a button.			The Perception attribute determines characters' 'Sequence' number, which then determines			the order of turns in combat; characters with a higher statistic in this attribute will be			placed at an earlier position in the sequence of turns, and subsequently get new turns			earlier. Perception also determines the maximum range of ranged weapons, and the chance			to hit with them.</p><br>			<p class="green">A diverse selection of recruitable non-player characters (NPCs) can be found to aid the			player character in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Examples include Ian, an experienced			traveler and gunman who can equip a pistol or SMG; and Dogmeat, an NPC of a dog the player			may recruit in Junktown by either wearing a leather jacket or feeding the dog an			iguana-on-a-stick. Unlike in Fallout 2, there is no limit to the number of NPCs that the			player may recruit, and NPCs' statistics and armor in Fallout remain unchanged through the				entire game; only their weapons may be upgraded.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-2" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-2">SPECIAL system</label>		<div><p class="green">The protagonist is governed by the system called SPECIAL (an acronym for "Strength,		Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck"), designed specifically		for Fallout and used in the other games in the series. The player begins Fallout by		selecting one of three characters to play as the protagonist, or alternatively they can		create one with custom attributes using the system. Character development is divided		into four categories: attributes, skills, traits and perks. These have been copied or		otherwise adapted in some form or another through the ensuing iterations of the series.</p><br>		<p class="green">Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck are the		seven basic attributes of every character in the game.The SPECIAL stats continually		add bonuses to skills.This is done 'on the fly', i.e. if the SPECIAL stats change,		the bonuses are automatically and instantly adjusted. Some 'perks' and coded events		within the game require a certain level of particular SPECIAL stats.</p><br>		<p class="green">There are 18 different skills in the game, ranging in value from 0 to 200 percent.		The starting values for Level 1 skills are determined by the player's seven basic 		attributes, and initially fall within the range of 0 to 50 percent. Every time the		player gains a level, skill points are awarded that can be used to improve the		character's skills. The player may choose to tag three skills that will improve at		twice the normal rate and receive a bonus at the start. Skills are divided into 		three categories: combat, active and passive. Books, although scarce in the early		game, can be found throughout the game world, and permanently improve a specific 		skill when read.However, after a skill reaches a certain level, books no longer 		have an impact. Some NPCs can also improve skills via training. Some skills are		also improved by having certain items equipped.For instance, a lockpick improves 		lock-picking skills. Stimulants can also temporarily boost a player's skills,		however, they often have adverse effects such as addiction and withdrawal.</p><br>		<p class="green">Traits are special character qualities which can have significant effects on gameplay.		At character creation, the player may choose up to two traits. Traits typically carry		benefits coupled with detrimental effects.For example, the trait "Small Frame" improves		agility by one point, but negatively affects maximum carrying capacity. Once a trait is		chosen, it is impossible to change, except by using the "Mutate" perk which allows a		player to change one trait, one time.</p><br>		<p class="green">Perks are a special element of the level up system. Every three levels (or every four if		the player chooses the "Skilled" trait), the player is presented with a list of perks and		can choose one to improve their character. Perks grant special effects, most of which are		not obtainable via the normal level up system. These include letting the player perform more		actions per round, or being able to heal wounds faster. Unlike traits, perks are purely		beneficial; they are offset only by the infrequency with which they are acquired.</p><br>		<p class="green">The game also tracks the moral quality of the player character's actions using a statistic		called Karma,as well as a series of reputations. Karma points are awarded for doing good		deeds, and are subtracted for doing evil deeds. The effect of this statistic during the		course of the game is minimal; however, the player character may receive one of a number		of "reputations", that act like perks, for meeting a certain threshold of such actions,		or for engaging in an action that is seen as singularly and morally reprehensible.</p></div><br></div> <!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Plot</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green">	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-3" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-3">Setting</label>		<div><p class="green">In the 21st century, a worldwide conflict is brought on by global petroleum shortage.		Several nations enter Resource Wars over the last of non-renewable commodities, namely		oil and uranium from 2052 to 2077. China invades Alaska in the winter of 2066, causing		the United States to go to war with China and using Canadian resources to supply their		war efforts, despite Canadian complaints. Eventually the United States violently		annexes Canada in February 2076 and reclaims Alaska nearly a year later. After years		of conflict, on October 23, 2077, a global nuclear war occurs. It is not known who		strikes first, but in less than two hours most major cities are destroyed.		The effects of the war do not fade for the next hundred years and as a consequence,		human society has collapsed leaving only survivor settlements barely able to eke out		a living in the barren wasteland, while a few live through the occurrence in underground		fallout shelters known as Vaults. One of these, Vault 13, is the protagonist's home in		Southern California, where the game begins in 2161, 84 years after the war.</p></div><br>				<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-4" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-4">Characters</label>		<div><p class="green">The player controls a vault resident sent into the wasteland to save the vault.		The player can create a custom protagonist or choose to be one of three already available;		Albert Cole, a negotiator and charismatic leader, whose background is somewhat in the legal		system; Natalia Dubrovhsky, a talented acrobat and intelligent and resourceful granddaughter		of a Russian diplomat in the Soviet consulate in Los Angeles, and Max Stone, the largest		person in the Vault, known for his strength and stamina but lacking intelligence. Each of the		three characters present either a diplomatic, stealthy or combative approach to the game. Games		set later in the Fallout series refer to the player's protagonist as "the Vault Dweller,"		and official canon states the Vault Dweller was a male, but his name is unspecified.		The player is also allowed to recruit three companions to aid them in their quest – Ian,		a guard in Shady Sands, Tycho, a desert ranger in Junktown, and Katja, a member of the		Followers of the Apocalypse living in the Boneyard. Other characters in the game include		Aredesh, the leader of Shady Sands, Killian Darkwater, the mayor of Junktown, the Master,		the leader of the super mutant army, and Morpheus, the master's right-hand as the leader		of the Children of the Cathedral.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-5" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-5">Story</label>		<div><p class="green">In Vault 13, the Water Chip, a computer chip responsible for the water recycling		and pumping machinery of the vault, malfunctions. With 150 days before the Vault's		water reserves run dry,the Vault Overseer tasks the protagonist, the Vault Dweller,		with finding a replacement.He or she is given a portable tablet-like device called the		"Pip-Boy 2000" that keeps track of map-making, objectives, and bookkeeping. Armed with 		the Pip-Boy 2000 and meager equipment,the main character is sent off on the quest. The		player has free rein across the Fallout world to travel where they wish and do as they		like, but other games clarify what the Vault Dweller canonically did.</p><br>		<p class="green">The player character travels to Vault 15, the closest known Vault that may be 		able to provide help, but finds it collapsed into ruin and abandoned. The survivors		of Vault 15 have founded a town named Shady Sands, and the player character is given		the options to defend them from the Khans, a group of raiders that attack the town, 		and radscorpions, mutated scorpions that plague the town's herds. The player character		then travels south to Junktown, where they can help the mayor, Killian Darkwater, bring		the corrupt casino head Gizmo to justice, or help Gizmo assassinate Killian to take		over the town. Further south the player character finds The Hub, a bustling merchant		city, where the player has the option to hire water caravans to aid Vault 13 and extend		their estimated survival by 100 days. With clues from the Hub, the player character		travels to Necropolis, a city of mutated humans called ghouls. Under the city the player		finds Vault 12 and recovers a Water Chip.</p><br>		<p class="green">Upon returning the chip, the Vault is saved, but the Overseer is concerned about		the reports of large mutated humans the player character encountered, dubbed 		"super mutants." Believing the mutations too widespread and extreme to be natural,		and that they pose a threat to the Vault, the Overseer charges the player character		to find the source of the mutations and stop them. The player finds aid in the		Brotherhood of Steel, remnants of the United States government and army that survived		the war and now research technology. The Brotherhood supplies the player character		with equipment and information on the super mutants. The player character travels to		the Boneyard, the ruins of Los Angeles, and finds the cult-like Children of the		Cathedral operating around the wasteland are a front for the Master, using the Children		to preach his message to wastelanders and get them to submit to him peacefully.</p><br>		<p class="green">The player character explores the Cathedral of the Children and finds a prototype		Vault beneath it where the Master commands his army. Disguised as one of the		Children, the player character infiltrates the Vault and destroys the Master.		The player then travels north to a military base, where the Master was using a		mutagen called the Forced Evolutionary Virus to mutate humans into his super		mutants. The player character destroys the base, stopping the creation of more		super mutants and splintering their army. The player character returns to the		Vault and is greeted at the entrance by the Overseer. The Overseer is happy that		the Vault's safety is secured, but fears the player character's adventure has		changed them, and that hero worship of them in the Vault may encourage others to		leave. For the greater good of the Vault and to preserve its isolation, the player		character is exiled into the wasteland.</p><br>		<p class="green">If the player does not return to the Vault with the Water Chip before the Vault's		water reserves run out, the game is automatically lost. In earlier versions of the		game, if the player did not destroy the military base and the Master before 500 days		passed, the mutants found Vault 13 and invaded it, resulting in an automatic loss.		This time limit is shortened to 400 days if the player hires water caravans from		the Hub, as the caravans traveling to the Vault allow the mutant scouts to find it		easier. The 1.1 patch of the game, and subsequent re-releases of the game, extend this		time limit to 13 years, effectively giving the player enough time to do as they wish.		There is also an optional alternate ending triggered if the player character has a		negative reputation or the "Bloody Mess" trait, where after the Overseer exiles them,		the player character shoots and kills him. In various points of the game, the player		also has the choice to join the super mutants, which results in a small		video showing the super mutants rampaging the Vault and ends the game.</p></div><br></div> <!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Development</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green">		<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-6" type="checkbox">		<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-6">History</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout was created by Interplay Entertainment as a spiritual successor to their 1988		post-apocalyptic role-playing game Wasteland. It is not an official sequel, although		it was initially developed as one, because Interplay did not have the rights to		Wasteland at that point.The budget for the game was approximately three million dollars.		In the early stages of planning, other settings based on the GURPS role-playing game system		handbooks were considered, including a time-travel theme with aliens and dinosaurs.		The game's working titles included GURPS: Wasteland and Vault 13: A GURPS Post-Nuclear Adventure.		The final title Fallout was suggested by the Interplay boss Brian Fargo.</p><br>		<p class="green">Tim Cain created the game engine and most of the design for the game. He worked on it,		by himself, developing the mechanics of the design and incorporating a then-popular pen and		paper role-playing game system GURPS by Steve Jackson Games, but that deal fell through.		According to IGN, this was due to Steve Jackson Games objecting to the excessive amounts of		violence and gore included in the game, forcing Interplay to change the already implemented		GURPS system to the internally developed SPECIAL system.

He built		the engine alone in six months, given no money and no resources, only time. Later, Cain assembled		a team of 30 people to work on the game for the next three years. The game was nearly cancelled		after Interplay acquired the licenses to the Forgotten Realms and Planescape Dungeons & Dragons		franchises, but Cain convinced Interplay to let him finish the work on his project. Later, after		the success of Diablo, Cain successfully resisted the pressure to convert the game to multiplayer		and real-time based.</p><br>		<p class="green">A number of well-known actors were cast as voice-talents. The game's narrations were performed by		Ron Perlman and the prologue featured one of the foremost iconic catch phrases of the game series:		"War. War never changes"; Perlman was re-invited to, and narrated, several later Fallout games. Other 		appearances included Richard Dean Anderson as Killian, David Warner as Morpheus, Tony Shalhoub		(credited as Tony Shalub) as Aradesh, Brad Garrett as Harry, Keith David as Decker, Richard Moll as		Cabot,and Tony Jay as The Mutant Lieutenant. Interplay intended to use "I Don't Want to Set the World		on Fire" by The Ink Spots for the theme song, but could not license the song because of a copyright		issue.This song was later licensed by Bethesda for Fallout 3.

Fallout's menu interfaces are		designed to resemble advertisements and toys of the same period; for example, the illustrations		on the character sheet mimic those of the board game Monopoly, and one of the game's loading		screens is an Indian Head test card. A lack of this retro stylization was one of the things for		which the Fallout spin-offs were criticized, as retro-futurism is a hallmark of the Fallout series.</p><br>		<p class="green">There are also many references to various works of post-apocalyptic science fiction, such as Mad Max		and Radioactive Dreams. One of the first available armors is a one-sleeved leather jacket that		resembles the jacket worn by Mel Gibson in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. The player can also get a dog,		as in Mad Max 2 and A Boy and His Dog, named Dogmeat. Fallout contains numerous Easter eggs referencing		1950s and 1960s pop culture. Many of these can be found in random encounters, which include a vanishing		TARDIS from Doctor Who (complete with sound effect), an enormous reptilian footprint, and a crashed		UFO containing a painting of Elvis Presley. The game also refers to other pieces of fiction, including		WarGames and Blade Runner.</p><br>		<p class="green">Although the time frame of Wasteland is completely different from Fallout—and despite the fact that the		game's designers deny that Fallout or Fallout 2 take place in the same universe as Wasteland—there are		many references to the events and the style of Wasteland in the Fallout series, which is why Fallout is		sometimes regarded as a spiritual successor to Wasteland. For example, the protagonist can meet an NPC		named Tycho, who mentions that he is a Desert Ranger and, under the right conditions, will talk of his		grandfather, who told him about Fat Freddy, a character from Las Vegas in that game.</p></div><br></div><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Reception</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green">	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-8" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-8">Response</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout was met with a very favorable critical reception.
