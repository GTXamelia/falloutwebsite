Players are not able to		respond to non-player characters, but they can still trade and gamble. Instead of towns, Fallout Tactics centers around		Brotherhood bunkers and missions. The bunkers serve as a central point for the Brotherhood, and players can obtain the		services of quartermasters, mechanics, personnel yeomen, and medics. Characters from completed missions occasionally visit		the bunkers.</p>	<br>		<p class="green">After receiving a mission briefing from the general in charge of the bunker, the player's squad can then move to the area		where the mission will take place. Among these locations are towns, factories, military encampments, or even a Vault. There,		the player is given a map of the area marked with objectives and notes.</p></div> <br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-2" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-2">Combat</label>		<div><p class="green">Unlike the previous two Fallout games which featured an individual turn-based system, and more recent ones which featured a		real-time game-play system, combat in Fallout Tactics operates differently. Fallout Tactics features three modes of combat:		Continuous Turn-Based (CTB), Individual Turn-Based (ITB), and Squad Turn-Based (STB). In CTB, everyone can act at the same		time, and action points are regenerated at a rate based on the Agility stat. ITB is the system used in the original games.		STB is a variation of that; each turn is given to a squad. Other changes include the ability to change stance, modifiers for		height, and setting sentry modes which let characters shoot automatically in CTB upon encountering an enemy.</p></div> 	<br></div> <!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Plot</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green"><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-3" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-3">Setting</label>		<div><p class="green">The plot of the game takes place in the American Midwest. When the game starts, the Brotherhood is trying to claim territory 		surrounding Chicago. By offering protection to villages of tribals, the Brotherhood is able to draft recruits from among the 		tribals. At the beginning of the game, the player character is an Initiate, a new recruit to the Brotherhood, tasked to lead 		a squad of soldiers made up of available initiates. Raiders in the area are the first challenge to the Brotherhood's 		authority, so the player's squad of initiates is dispatched to kill the bandit leaders and mop up the bandit threat. As the 		campaign against the raiders succeeds in dispersing them into the wasteland, the player character is accepted fully into the 		Brotherhood and learns the eventual goal of the Brotherhood: a campaign west across the Great Plains towards the Rocky 		Mountains in search of Vault Zero, the one-time nucleus and command center of the pre-War vault network, where the most 		senior government, scientific and military leaders were housed and the highest technology available was maintained.</p><br>			<p class="green">The next challenge in the Brotherhood's campaign are the beastlords, humans who are able to control the animals of		the wastes, and who have come to use deathclaws as their servants. Once again, the Brotherhood fights the menace, and once again		the Brotherhood emerges victorious. Before the Brotherhood can rest, however, they encounter a new foe as they push into post-war		Missouri, an area known as "the Belt": the remnants of the mutant army they were sent to destroy. The initial battles are costly		to the Brotherhood. Outgunned and outmanned, the Brotherhood is overwhelmed outside of St. Louis. There General Barnaky, head of		the Brotherhood, is captured by Toccomata, the leader of the mutant army. Although the Brotherhood is able to withdraw, they		remain under constant attack. A squad dispatched to destroy a munitions manufacturing plant instead finds a laboratory dedicated		to curing mutant sterility. The Brotherhood claims the lab in order to use it as a future bargaining chip. A few days later, at		the ghoul town of Gravestone, in the ruins of Kansas City, Brotherhood scouts find an intact nuclear bomb. The Brotherhood defends		the town from several mutant encroachments, and they are soon able to remove the weapon to a safe bunker.</p><br>			<p class="green">Brotherhood scouting reveals the base of the mutants to be at Osceolla, near the ruins of one of the wrecked Brotherhood		zeppelins. A squad fights its way into the base. Inside, they find Toccomata, who is dying. He reveals that General Barnaky had been		lost to an unknown menace from the west that was too powerful for even the mutant army. As the squad enters the room where the mutant		leader was hiding, they find Paladin Latham, one of the leaders of the Brotherhood air convoy. He tells the squad that after crashing,		he fought Gammorin in hand-to-hand combat for leadership of the mutants. Latham won, but a head injury from the battle became infected,		and he soon became delusional. Latham assumed the identity of Gammorin, and led his new army against his old allies. The squad kills		Latham before he can endanger the Brotherhood even more.</p>	<br>			<p class="green">Soon, the menace from the west reveals itself: a robot army is sweeping across the American Midwest. The Reavers, a cult		dedicated to technology worship, is caught between the Brotherhood and the robots as the two armies clash in Kansas. Although the		Reavers try to wage a two-fronted war, they are soon beaten, and seek sanctuary among the Brotherhood in exchange for an		electromagnetic pulse weapon. The Brotherhood agrees, and a squad armed with the new technology destroys a robot repair plant as they		push into Colorado, towards Vault Zero. It is revealed that the robots are originating from Vault Zero, and are being directed by an		enigmatic enemy known as the Calculator. Evidence uncovered by the Brotherhood points to a catastrophic experiment in the Vault that		created the Calculator from a fusion of computers and human brains. The robots regroup, but the Brotherhood is able to use the momentum		to destroy a robot manufacturing plant. The robots disrupt this plan when they capture Bartholemew Kerr, a merchant who had roamed		among the Brotherhood bunkers. If the robots could gain this information from him, they would be able to destroy the Brotherhood.		The squad arrives in time, however, and they put an end to the merchant's life. While there, they also discover the lobotomized body of		General Barnaky.</p>				<br>			<p class="green">As the robots press hard, the Brotherhood creates a plan to destroy the robots at their base at Vault Zero, located in		Cheyenne Mountain. Using the captured nuclear warhead, the Brotherhood hopes to blast an entrance into the vault. After a tough		fight up the slopes of Cheyenne Mountain, a Brotherhood squad places the warhead. The explosion does its job, and two squads enter		into the bunker. The power was disabled by the blast, however, so one of the squads must find the auxiliary power so the elevators		can be used. Meanwhile, the robots are attacking the Brotherhood's bunker. At the vault, the power is soon back on, and the squad		proceeds to the bottom level. There they encounter the last of the robot army, led by a cyborg General Barnaky. The General does not		attack, however, when he is reminded of his promise to make the world safe for his wife, Maria. The squad then makes it to the		Calculator.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-4" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-4">Endings</label>		<div><p class="green">After defeating the last robots that guard the bunker and destroying the brains that kept the Calculator alive,		the squad is asked by the Calculator to join minds with it in order to end the war and bring peace to the world. The squad is given		the choice to either destroy the Calculator, sacrifice a character to join with it (although ANY squad mate can be used, the story		assumes that the Warrior was the one who joined with the Calculator), or (if he has been kept alive) allow General Barnaky to join		with it.</p><br>			<p class="green">Allowing the Calculator to self-destruct allows the Brotherhood to capture Vault 0 and use it as its primary base of		operations. However, the Calculator was in fact the most valuable asset the Vault housed - without its databanks, the vault is just		another cache of old technology, not a new industrial resource. Nevertheless, Vault 0 becomes the new Brotherhood of Steel base.		From here, the Brotherhood rebuilds by deepening its technology and information trade with tribals and other settlers gaining new		recruits and survival techniques in return. While at first the Brotherhood is damaged and unable to fight raiders as well as they		could previously, guerrilla tactics and swelled recruit ranks eventually allow the Brotherhood to bring some order to the Wasteland.		Unfortunately, despite the recovery and improvement of the environment, the Brotherhood has to put any plans on going back west to		reunite with the original Brotherhood of Steel on indefinite hold (this may be the canon ending as it has been stated that by 2277		the Midwestern Brotherhood is only a small detachment, though this could be just the brothers loyal to the West Coast Brotherhood).</p>	<br>			<p class="green">Repairing the Calculator with a character's brain means the Vault's resources are fully available to the Brotherhood,		increasing its power exponentially. The Midwest will be restored to its former glory in decades, not centuries. However, that		character's ethics now guide the Calculator's actions.</p><br>			<p class="green">If the character in question had committed unethical acts throughout the game, the new Calculator outlaws discrimination		against mutated species (mutants, ghouls, deathclaws and humans) in the name of expediency. For the same reason, it has the		Brotherhood's elders quietly assassinated and takes control, planning a similar fate for the Brotherhood in California.</p><br>			<p class="green">However, if the person in question acted with distinction (a difficult feat, as the Calculator's former brains are		considered innocent), discrimination is still outlawed, but no harmful acts are committed. Mankind, both Prime and not, prospers		greatly at the hands of the benevolent Brotherhood and the Warrior-Calculator hybrid's machine legions. However, both the		Brotherhood Elders and the Warrior-Calculator wonder how things will turn out when this great expanded sphere of justice and		control meets with the dogmatic original Brotherhood.</p><br>			<p class="green">If Barnaky becomes the donor, the new Calculator will start a campaign of genocide against all "unpure" humans, 		eventually driving them back to the West Coast where the original Brotherhood of Steel awaits. Nevertheless, Barnaky will lead		mankind to a brighter future, giving humanity a second chance at civilization.</p></div><br></div><!--Music--><h4 class="green">Music of Fallout Tactics</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4>	<iframe class="music" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/173098893%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-JH7eO&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe><div style="text-align:center"><br><!-- Fallout Tactics Pictures --><h4 class="green">Fallout Tactics Pictures</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4><ul class="enlarge">	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures">Fallout Tactics<br>March 15, 2001</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic2.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic2.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures">Fallout Tactics<br>March 15, 2001</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic3.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic3.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures">Fallout Tactics<br>March 15, 2001</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic4.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic4.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures">Fallout Tactics<br>March 15, 2001</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic5.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout 2" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic5.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Pictures">Fallout Tactics<br>March 15, 2001</span></li></ul></div><br><footer class="green" style="font-size:10px; text-align: center">COPYRIGHT 2075-2077 ROBCO INDUSTIRES</footer></body></html>
