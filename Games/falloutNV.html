The game also made a		change from the true bullet flight paths in Fallout 3 to simulated bullet flight paths, which means the bullets, when fired,		originate from the center of the screen's crosshairs, rather than the tip of the gun's barrel.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-2" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-2">Hardcore mode</label>		<div><p class="green">Hardcore mode is an optional setting which makes the game more realistic, with gameplay elements such as dehydration, and		non-instantaneous healing.

Before the Great War was the Resource Wars, during which the United Nations		disbanded, a plague rendered the United States paranoid, and Canada was annexed. The city of Las Vegas itself wasn't hit as		hard as most of the other districts, with most buildings being left intact as a result. The Hoover Dam supplies free		electricity and water to those who control it.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-4" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-4">Story</label>		<div><p class="green">The story has taken some parts from the Fallout and Fallout 2 stories, and is for the most part unrelated to its predecessor,		Fallout 3.</p><br>		<p class="green">Fallout: New Vegas takes place in 2281, four years after the events of Fallout 3, thirty-nine years after Fallout 2, and one-		hundred-twenty years after Fallout. The New California Republic plays a major part in the game's story, being in a three-way		struggle amongst the Caesar's Legion slavers, and the mysterious Mr. House.</p><br>		<p class="green">The Courier, the player's character, was meant to deliver a package from Primm to New Vegas. However, he/she is intercepted		by the Great Khans led by a mysterious man, who shoots him/her and takes the package, leaving the Courier for dead in a		shallow grave. The Courier is later found by a robot named Victor, and is taken to the settlement of Goodsprings, where		Doctor Mitchell saves his/her life. After the Courier is given some medical tests, the player is pushed back into the open		world, and the quest Ain't That a Kick in the Head begins. Fallout: New Vegas has a definitive ending, unlike Fallout 3.</p><br>		<p class="green">Endings for Fallout: New Vegas are dependent on what actions the player took via quests during the game,		with separate endings being shown for each major location, political faction, and recruitable companion.</p></div><br></div><!--Information Tabs--><h4 class="green">Reception</h4><h4 class="green">=================================</h4><div class="green">	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-5" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-5">Controversies and censorship</label>		<div><p class="green">In the German version, there is no gore. German players that want the full Fallout experience can - as with Fallout 3 - buy		the Austrian version which basically features the uncut PEGI version with German speech and text. However, the German		Ultimate Edition is completely uncensored.</p><br>		<p class="green">Just like in Fallout 3, the Fat Man weapon was once again renamed to the "Nuka Launcher" in the Japanese version of Fallout:		New Vegas. The Little Boy mod, however, was not.</p><br>		<p class="green">Fallout: New Vegas was officially banned in the United Arab Emirates, but the ban was repealed later as it did not contain		enough violence to meet the criteria of a ban after a test run was made. The ban lasted for about a day after the game's		release and the game was soon stocked in stores fully uncensored (with gore) alongside the collector's edition. The ultimate		edition was released without any issues as the original game was already in stock and the ultimate edition was simply the		same game with all DLC included.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-6" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-6">Response</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout: New Vegas received a positive critical reception, with critics praising the gameplay improvements and expanded		content over Fallout 3, while criticizing familiarity and technical issues. As of November 8, 2010, the game had shipped 5		million copies worldwide, achieving revenue of $300 million. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research		firm, estimates that the game has sold 11.6 million copies worldwide</p><br>		<p class="green">IGN's Keza MacDonald praised the game's script, but criticized the character models and facial animation as "wooden and		unbelievable". Eurogamer commented that "Obsidian has created a totally compelling world and its frustrations pale into		insignificance compared to the immersive, obsessive experience on offer. Just like the scorched scenery that provides its		epic backdrop, New Vegas is huge and sprawling, sometimes gaudy, even downright ugly at times – but always effortlessly,		shamelessly entertaining." According to GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd, the game's "familiar rhythm will delight fans of the series,		and the huge world, expansive quests, and hidden pleasures will have [the players] itching to see what other joys you might		uncover. However, as time wears on, the constant glitches invade almost every element of the game and eventually grow		wearisome."</p><br>		<p class="green">Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann reviewed Fallout: New Vegas for the Xbox 360 positively, despite its many crash bugs and		glitches. Gerstmann wrote: "When I reflect on the experience, I'll probably think about the times the game locked up on me or		broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it. If you were		able to look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas will eventually show you a real good		time." 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I		single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or		occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical		anomalies. On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave		Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when		I need them the most during a battle. These are some of the most frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game,		especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy."</p></div><br></div><br><!--Music--><h4 class="green">Music of Fallout New Vegas</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4><iframe class="music" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/120147534&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe><div style="text-align:center"><br><!-- Fallout New Vegas Pictures --><h4 class="green">Fallout Fallout New Vegas</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4><ul class="enlarge">	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout New Vegas" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="FalloutNV Pictures">Fallout New Vegas<br>October 19, 2010</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic2.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout New Vegas" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic2.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="FalloutNV Pictures">Fallout New Vegas<br>October 19, 2010</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic3.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout New Vegas" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic3.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="FalloutNV Pictures">Fallout New Vegas<br>October 19, 2010</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic4.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout New Vegas" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic4.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="FalloutNV Pictures">Fallout New Vegas<br>October 19, 2010</span></li>	<li><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic5.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Fallout New Vegas" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="../media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic5.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="FalloutNV Pictures">Fallout New Vegas<br>October 19, 2010</span></li></ul></div><br><footer class="green" style="font-size:10px; text-align: center">COPYRIGHT 2075-2077 ROBCO INDUSTIRES</footer></body></html>
