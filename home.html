Fallout was originally intended to run under the GURPS role-playing game system. However,		a disagreement with the creator of GURPS,Steve Jackson, over the game's violent content required Black Isle Studios to		develop the new SPECIAL system.Fallout's atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-WWII America and the nuclear paranoia		that was widespread at that time.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-2" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-2">Fallout 2 Overview</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout 2 was released in 1998, with several improvements over the first game, including an improved game engine, the ability		to set attitudes of non-player character (NPC) party members and the ability to push people who are blocking doors.		Additional features included several changes to the game world, including significantly more pop culture jokes and parodies,		such as multiple Monty Python-referencing special random encounters, and self-parodying dialogue that broke the fourth wall		to mention game mechanics. Fallout 2 takes place eighty years after Fallout, and centers around a descendant of the Vault		Dweller, the protagonist of Fallout. The player assumes the role of the Chosen One as he tries to save his village, Arroyo,		from severe famine and droughts. After saving the village, the Chosen One must save it again, this time from the Enclave, the		remnants of the pre-war United States Government.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-3" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-3">Fallout: Tactics Overview</label>		<div><p class="green">Tactics is the first Fallout game not to require the player to fight in a turn-based mode, and it is also the first to allow		the player to customize the skills, perks, and combat  actions of the rest of the party. Fallout Tactics focuses on tactical		combat rather than role-playing; the new combat system included different modes, stances, and modifiers, but the player had		no dialogue options. Most of the criticisms of the game came from its incompatibility with the story of the original two		games, not from its gameplay. Fallout: Tactics includes a multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against squads of		other characters controlled by other players. Unlike the previous two games, which are based in California, Fallout: Tactics		takes place in the Midwestern United States. The game was released in early 2001 to generally favorable reviews.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-4" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-4">Fallout 3 Overview</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout 3 was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released on October 28, 2008. The story picks up thirty years after the		setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear war that devastated the game's world. The player is a Vault-dweller in		Vault 101 who is forced to flee when the Overseer tries to arrest him/her in response to the player's father leaving the		Vault. Once free, the player is dubbed the Lone Wanderer and ventures into the Wasteland in and around Washington, D.C.,		known as the Capital Wasteland, to find his/her father. It differs from  previous games in the series by utilizing 3D		graphics, a free-roam gaming world, and real-time combat, in contrast to previous games' 2D isometric graphics and turn-based		combat. It was developed simultaneously for the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 using the Gamebryo engine. On release it		received highly positive reviews, garnering 94/100, 92/100, and 93/100 averages scores on Metacritic for the PC, PS3 and Xbox		360 versions of the game, respectively. It won IGN's 2008 Overall Game of the Year Award, Xbox 360 Game of the Year, Best RPG, and		Best Use of Sound, as well as E3's Best of the Show and Best Role Playing Game.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-5" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-5">Fallout: New Vegas Overview</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout: New Vegas was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released on October 19, 2010. The development team included 		developers who previously worked on Fallout and Fallout 2. Fallout: New Vegas is not a direct sequel to Fallout 3; rather, it 		is a stand-alone product. Events in the game follow four years after Fallout 3 and offer a similar role-playing experience, 		but no characters from that game appear. The player assumes the role of a courier in the post-apocalyptic world of the Mojave 		Wasteland. As the game begins, the Courier is shot in the head and left for dead shortly before being found and brought to a 		doctor in the nearby town of Goodsprings, marking the start of the game and the Courier's search for his or her would-be 		murderer. The city of New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic interpretation of Las Vegas with only four standing casinos; 		"Gomorrah", "The Atomic Wrangler," "The Tops," and "Ultra-Luxe", while the "Lucky 38" is a shell of a casino with a major 		plot.</p></div><br>	<input class="toggle-box" id="identifier-6" type="checkbox">	<label class="green" style="cursor:pointer" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" for="identifier-6">Fallout 4 Overview</label>		<div><p class="green">Fallout 4 is the latest in the series developed by Bethesda Game Studios.

China invades Alaska in the winter of 2066,	causing the United States to go to war with China and using Canadian resources to	supply their war efforts, despite Canadian complaints. Eventually the United States	violently annexes Canada in February 2076 and reclaims Alaska nearly a year later.	After years of conflict, on October 23, 2077, a global nuclear war occurs. It is not	known who strikes first, but in less than two hours most major cities are destroyed.	The effects of the war do not fade for the next hundred years and as a consequence,	human society has collapsed leaving only survivor settlements barely able to eke out	a living in the barren wasteland, while a few live through the occurrence in	underground fallout shelters known as Vaults built by the government to protect it's	citizens from the coming apocalypse.</p><br><!--Fake Advertisement--><div class="adver"><h4 class="green">The following advertisement is brought to you by Vault-Tec</h4><h4 class="green">Prepare for the Future, today</h4>	<img src="media/images/VaultTecLogo.png" alt="GMIT banner" width="300" height="100"><h4 class="green">=========================================</h4>	<iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwQN92uSqWc?showinfo=0&rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br><!--Fallout Picture Timeline--><div style="text-align:center"><h4 class="green">Fallout Picture Timeline</h4><h4 class="green">======================</h4><ul class="enlarge">	<li><img src="media/images/games/fallout1/fallout1pic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Dechairs" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="media/images/games/fallout1/fallout1pic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout1 Picture"><br>Fallout 1<br>September 30, 1997</span></li>	<li><img src="media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Dechairs" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="media/images/games/fallout2/fallout2pic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout2 Picture"><br>Fallout 2<br>September 30, 1998</span></li>	<li><img src="media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Dechairs" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="media/images/games/falloutT/falloutTpic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="falloutT Picture"><br>Fallout Tactics<br>March 15, 2001</span></li>	<li><img src="media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Dechairs" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="media/images/games/fallout3/fallout3pic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout3 Picture"><br>Fallout 3<br>October 28, 2008</span></li>	<li><img src="media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Dechairs" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="media/images/games/falloutNV/falloutNVpic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="falloutNV Picture"><br>Fallout New Vegas<br>October 19, 2010</span></li>	<li><img src="media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic1.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Dechairs" onmouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()"><span style="color:black;padding-top:5;line-height:150%;"><img src="media/images/games/fallout4/fallout4pic1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="fallout4 Picture"><br>Fallout 4<br>November 10, 2001</span></li></ul></div><footer class="green" style="font-size:10px; text-align: center">COPYRIGHT 2075-2077 ROBCO INDUSTIRES</footer></body></html>
